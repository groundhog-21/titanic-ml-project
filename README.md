# Titanic — Machine Learning from Disaster

A focused, reproducible machine learning project for the Kaggle **Titanic** competition.

**Goal:** Predict passenger survival.  
**Emphasis:** Feature stability, reproducibility, and preserving high‑performing models.

## Highlights
- Clean, minimal feature sets outperform over‑engineered pipelines
- Random Forest baselines with careful tuning are highly competitive
- Exceptional models are preserved as reproducible artifacts (“gold models”)

## Structure
- `data/` — raw, interim, and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` — EDA, feature engineering, modeling, error analysis  
- `models/` — experiments and frozen high‑performing models  
- `submissions/` — Kaggle submission files  

## Environment
Python 3.12, local development, Jupyter notebooks.
